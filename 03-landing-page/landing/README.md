Style your own landing page

Your landing page should at least include:

- A **Hero / Banner** section presenting your product with a call to action.
- A **How it works** section (what components could be used to break down the different aspects of your product/service).
- A **Footer**.

*⚠️ Never start coding a page without knowing how it will look!*
So, style it on Figma before
